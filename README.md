## Introduction

### Background

`concurrent-containers` is a C++17 header only library that implements thread-safe versions of containers similar to those provided in the standard template library. As of v0.1.0, the library supports `cds::array`.

The interfaces exposed by the containers are very similar to those in the stl, and can be used interchangeably in most circumstances.
